# NYC Citibike

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to take NYC Citibike data and build visualizations that tell a story about the data. By using Pandas to clean up the data and Tableau to visualize the data, we are able to see how gender impacts Citibike usage in NYC.

## Results

### Viz #1: Gender Breakdown

This pie chart shows the number of rides by gender. Here we can see that about 2/3 of users are male.

### Viz #2: August Peak Hours

This horizontal bar chart is showing the number of rides for the month of August broken down by hour. Peak hours seem to be in the morning before work hours and the afternoon.

### Viz #3: Checkout Time for Users

This line chart is showing number of rides by trip duration broken down by hours and minutes. We can see that trip durations usually last 3-7 hours.
  
### Viz #4: Checkout Times by Gender

This line chart is the same as the previous chart except it is being broken down by gender. We can see that there are more male users than female users no matter how long the trip is.

### Viz #5: Trips by Weekday per Hour

This heat map shows the number of bikes per weekday and hour. More bikes tend to be used Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays around 5-6pm.

### Viz #6: Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

<img src="https://github.com/kimcheese33/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips_weekday_hour_gender.png"/>

This heat map is the same as the previous chart except it is being broken down by gender also. We can see that across the board males use bikes more than females.

### Viz #7: User Trips by Gender by Weekday

<img src="https://github.com/kimcheese33/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips_gender_weekday.png"/>

This heat map is showing user number of bikes broken down by user type (Customer or Subscriber), gender, and day of the week. We can see that subscribers tend to use bikes more than customers, and males use bikes more than females. Thursday also appears to be the most popular day to ride bikes.

## Summary

Based off of the results, we can see that males use Citibikes more than females across the board. In addition, the most popular times to use Citibikes are weekdays before and after work hours. Two additional charts we could've built would be a combination bar chart showing number of bikes broken down by gender and age and a chart a chart showing number of rides broken down by gender and employment status.
